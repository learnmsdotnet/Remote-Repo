Connection String Understanding:

Example of Connection string with Windows based Authentication:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Data Source=PC238395;Initial Catalog=LEARNDBMP01;Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False

Data Source=PC238395;				//where is the SQL server or the name of the server where SQL Server database is hosted
Initial Catalog=LEARNDBMP01;		//this is the name of the database
Integrated Security=True;			//authentication information about how to connect the database (connect using credentials which we used to connect the system/server)
Pooling=False						//hosting (at later stage) - its optional 

Example of Connection string with SQL based Authentication:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Data Source=PC238395;Initial Catalog=LEARNDBMP01;Integrated Security=False;uid=sa;password=Pa$$w0rd;Pooling=False

Data Source=PC238395;				//Name of the SQL Server to connect (Server Name)
Initial Catalog=LEARNDBMP01;		//Name of the Database to connect
Integrated Security=False;			//Authentication type: false (not going to use windows based authentication)
uid=sa;								//Using which user id should we connect SQL Server
password=Pa$$w0rd;					//the password of the user id to connect
Pooling=False						//hosting (at later stage) - its optional
